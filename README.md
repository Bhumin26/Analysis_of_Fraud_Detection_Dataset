# Analysis_of_Fraud_Detection_Dataset
 The Python script outlines a systematic approach for building a fraud detection model through data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. While promising, further steps like model validation, addressing data imbalance, and optimization are needed for real-world reliability.

 **Findings:**
 
1. Data Import and Initial Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3 .Data Transformation
4. Model Development
5. Model Evaluation
6. Interpretation of Results
7. Model Validation
